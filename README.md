🌸 Iris Flower Classification – Machine Learning Project

This project is created as part of the Cognetix Technology Internship – Foundational Stage.
The goal is to classify Iris flowers into three species based on four measurable features.

📌 Project Overview

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers categorized into:

Iris-setosa

Iris-versicolor

Iris-virginica

Each sample includes:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Using these features, a Decision Tree Classifier is trained to predict the flower species.
The model takes user input through the terminal and outputs the predicted species along with accuracy.

📂 Dataset

File used: iris.data

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Install required libraries:
pip install pandas scikit-learn

2. Run the script:
python iris_classification.py

====== IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION ======

Enter flower measurements to predict the species.

Enter Sepal Length (cm): 5.1

Enter Sepal Width  (cm): 3.5

Enter Petal Length (cm): 1.4

Enter Petal Width  (cm): 0.2

✅Output:
----------------------------------------
 Predicted Species: Iris-setosa
----------------------------------------
Model Accuracy: 100.00%
----------------------------------------
