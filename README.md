🌸 Iris Flower Classification – Machine Learning Project

This project is created as part of the Cognetix Technology Internship – Foundational Stage.
The goal is to classify Iris flowers into three species based on four measurable features.

📌 Project Overview

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers categorized into:

Iris-setosa

Iris-versicolor

Iris-virginica

Each sample includes:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Using these features, a Decision Tree Classifier is trained to predict the flower species.
The model takes user input through the terminal and outputs the predicted species along with accuracy.
